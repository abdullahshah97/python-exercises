Hello, I am Abdullah Shah
I am an aspiring...I dunno software engineer
I suck at it right now and I am going to get better
I have been learning Pyton and taking my time
But its time to get a move on so I will just be doing the exercises as fast as I can
Soon I will be programming a video game and some data programs and a website.
Sounds like fun
I want to learn JS next and some Python libraries
